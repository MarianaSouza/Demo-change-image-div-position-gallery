# Changing the order of an image and its description in a gallery

When the screen is larger than 768px, the order of the image and description in the second column (.single-box:nth-child(2)) will change by using CSS. Take a look at main.css lines 65-75

This project also includes an example of how to use the library baguetteBox.js to create a lightbox. Open the foolowing link and click on an image to see a nice lightbox.
